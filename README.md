# CEG-2136 Computer Architecture I
Instructors:   
Dr. Voicu Groza, P.Eng.   
Dr. Fadi Malek, P.Eng

>“Computer Architecture I” is addressed to a broad range of audience, for all undergraduate
programs offered in the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, from
Electrical Engineering to Computer Science and Computing Technologies. In this course,
Hardware meets Software at the closest level. Students learn fundamentals of computer
organization, while designing, implementing and testing an educational computer. A traditional
“bottom-up” design approach is employed to build a basic computer, by devising and
analyzing logic components and dedicated digital modules that eventually are used for
assembling a processor capable to execute a specified instruction list. The basic processor is
practically implemented on a FPGA board, and, in order to demonstrate its operation, short
programs (in machine code and assembly language) are conceived and run on this platform. 
>Design a digital computer to execute a given instruction set. Design of digital computers.
Register transfer and micro-operations. Designing the instruction set, Central Processing Unit
(CPU) and CPU control. Basic machine language programming. Using pipelines for CPU
design. Designing the memory unit. Designing Input-Output subsystem.

>Course Learning Outcomes   
By the end of the course, students:   
 Will understand the computer elements and the fundamentals of computer organization,
and will get knowledge on the principles of computer architecture.    
 Have gained experience with basic design at various levels, from instruction set
architecture (ISA) to datapath and control logic; small projects will be developed by using
modern CAD environments and will be practically implemented on Field Programmable
Gate Arrays (FPGA’s).    
 Developing programs in machine language that run on their own designed/built computers,
students will sense and understand the interface between the software and computer
hardware.
